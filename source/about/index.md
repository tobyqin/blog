Hi, my name is Toby. I am a software engineer in testing, usually called as QA engineer. I am caring on product quality and focusing on automation testing. I have worked in this area for more than 6 years.

At spare time, I like to do a lot of things, reading, sports, photography, music. Be interesting is the most important thing in my life.

> 你好，我是一名中国人，我的名字叫顺溜。我是一个犯了严重网瘾的人，脾气也不是很好，长期需要电击治疗。如果长时间没有电击我就会在深夜写代码，刷题目，做各种勾当。如果你不巧在网上遇到了我，请礼貌相待，如果你对我恶言相加，我会顺着网线过来掐死你的，信不信由你。
