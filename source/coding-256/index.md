# Coding.NET 2**8 Puzzle

![](https://dn-coding-net-production-static.qbox.me/512b2a62-956b-4ef8-8e84-b3c66e71468f.png)

I click the [2**8 button](https://ide.coding.net/256) today, and it is my first time to try code in WebIDE. I have to say this is an interesting idea to let user like me to get fun with the product. So I spent around 3 hours to figure out the secret of your puzzle.

## Hints

1. I get tips by typing `help` everywhere, so I am able hack `gateway` via `jumper` very soon.
2. I like to search internet by [google](https://www.google.com), so I am able to find the password for all users.
3. I found source code of your project at github - [hack_ide](https://github.com/vangie/hack_ide/tree/master/lib/hack_ide)
4. I am not sure you guys open sourcing the project is by design or by mistake, so I can find passwords without too much efforts.

## Steps

The mission is trying to get all parts of source code - `Coding-WebIDE-Community-x.zip`

### part 1:

### Finally

It is fun, I don't know how many people have solved your puzzle, I am also not sure if I reach to the end or not.

However, have fun in work in life is the most important thing.

OK, I got to know this is a game started at 2016/9/12, I am quite late so missed a lot of fun :-(
